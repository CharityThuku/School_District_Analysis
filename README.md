# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
Using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Python, we helped Maria generate a report for the school board that shows the trends in student funding and student performance. 
We used key metrics systems, cleaned the dataset and formatted it to display how perfomance differed based on student grade, school district, school types and school attended.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to use Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Python, to run through a large CSV file and output data that is readable. We are provided with large datasets and the task is to clean and format the data in order to generate a report that portray correlations and trends between different aspects of the data.

## Results

As seen in the results above, by taking out Thomas High School, there was not a significant change to the results. The average math score decreased by .2 points and the average reading score remained unchanged. The percentage of passing math and passing reading decreased by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. Overall the passing percentage only decreased by 1%. Therefore, the conclusion is that Thomas High School did not significantly affected the school district summary.
